# Arithmetic Operators in Python

# 1.  Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication ,division and also python have floor division,exponentiation.

# .  Addition ( + ) => This operator is a binary operator and is used to add two operands.
# . Subtraction ( - ) => This operator is a binary operator and is used to subtract two operands.
# . Multiplication ( * ) => This operator is a binary operator and is used to multiply two operands.
# . Division ( / ) => This is a binary operator that is used to divide the first operand(dividend) by the second operand(divisor) and give the quotient as result.
# . Modulus ( % ) => This is a binary operator that is used to return the remainder when the first operand(dividend) is divided by the second operand(divisor).
# . Exponentiation ( * * ) => The performs exponential (power) calculation on operators
# . Floor division ( / / ) => The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed.
