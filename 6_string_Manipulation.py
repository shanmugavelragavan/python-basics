# String Manipulation in Python
# 1. String manipulation is a process of manipulating the string, such as slicing, parsing, analyzing, etc. String slicing in python programming is all about fetching a substring from a given string by slicing it from a start to end index.

#  Syntax :
#    s [ start : end ]
#    s [ start : ]
#    s [ : end ]
#    s [ : : ]

# 2. This program is using the concept of slicing in python, which allows you to extract a portion of a string by specifying a range of indices.

# 3. The following operations are performed in the above code:

# . print(s): This line will print the original string "sample".
# . print(s[0:2]): This line uses slicing to extract a substring of the original string "sa", starting at index 0 and ending at index 2 (not included).
# . print(s[:5]): This line uses slicing to extract a substring of the original string "sampl", starting at index 0 and ending at index 5 (not included).
# . print(s[1:]): This line uses slicing to extract a substring of the original string "ample", starting at index 1 and going till the end of the string.
# . print(s[-1]): This line uses slicing to extract the last character of the string "e" by specifying the index as -1, as in python, negative index is used to access elements from the end of the list.
# . print(s[-2:-1]): This line uses slicing to extract the second last character of the string "l" by specifying the range as -2 to -1, as in python
